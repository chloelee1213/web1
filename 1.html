<h2>GERMAN LANGUAGE 독일어</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language" target="_blank" title="German Langugage - Wikipedia">German</a> is a West Germanic language that is mainly spoken in <u>Central Europe</u>. It is the most widely spoken and official or co-official language in <strong>Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein.</strong>It is also one of the three official languages of Luxembourg and a co-official language in the Opole Voivodeship in Poland. The languages which are most similar to German are the other members of the West Germanic language branch: Afrikaans, Dutch, English, the Frisian languages, Low German/Low Saxon, Luxembourgish, and Yiddish. There are also strong similarities in vocabulary with Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, although those belong to the North Germanic group. German is the second most widely spoken Germanic language, after English.</p><img src="German book.jpg" width="70%"><p>One of the major languages of the world, German is the first language of almost 100 million people worldwide and the most widely spoken native language in the European Union.[2][8] Together with French, German is the second most commonly spoken foreign language in the EU after English, making it the second biggest language in the EU in terms of overall speakers.[9] German is also the second most widely taught foreign language in the EU after English at primary school level (but third after English and French at lower secondary level),[10] the fourth most widely taught non-English language in the US[11] (after Spanish, French and American Sign Language), and the second most commonly used scientific
language[12] as well as the third most widely used language on websites after English
and Russian.</P>
