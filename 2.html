<h2>JAPANESE LANGUAGE 일본어</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language" target="_blank" title="Japanese Langugage - Wikipedia">Japanese</a> is an <strong>East Asian
  language spoken by about 128 million people</strong>, <u>primarily in Japan</u>,
   where it is the national language. It is a member of the Japonic
   (or Japanese-Ryukyuan) language family, and its relation to other languages, such as Korean,
   is debated. Japanese has been grouped with language families such as Ainu, Austroasiatic,
   and the now-discredited Altaic, but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance.

Along with kanji, the Japanese writing system primarily uses two syllabic (or moraic) scripts, hiragana (ひらがな or 平仮名) and katakana (カタカナ or 片仮名). Latin script is used in a limited fashion, such as for imported acronyms, and the numeral system uses mostly Arabic numerals alongside traditional Chinese numerals.</p>
